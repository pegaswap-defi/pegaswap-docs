            <p>One of the growing complaints about projects built on Ethereum are the high fees and slow transactions from the network. PegaSwap doesnâ€™t use the Ethereum network though, it uses the BSC network and BEP-20 tokens. As a result the fees paid are much lower, typically ranging from $0.04 to $0.20, and transactions take less than 5 seconds on average. Compare that with Ethereum, where fees have been above $20 for much of 2021 and transactions take up to 5 minutes to confirm.</p>
